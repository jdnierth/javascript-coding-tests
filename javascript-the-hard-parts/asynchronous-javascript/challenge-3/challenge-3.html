<h1>Challenge 3</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        Write code that will log to the console, 'I am at the beginning of the code'.
    </li>
    <li>
Beneath that console log, set a timer (see setTimeout) that will log to the console 'I am in the setTimeout callback function' after 3 seconds (3000 ms)
    </li>
    <li>
        Next, add code to the end of the challenge to log 'I am at the end of the code'. Now re-run the code.
    </li>
    <li>
Make sure the 'console' and 'output' panes are showing (click the tabs above if not) and then run your code with the 'Run with JS' button.
    </li>
	<li>
Clear the console. Change the delay time in the time from 3000 ms to 0. Think hard about how the order should change and then run the code again.
	</li>
</ul>
