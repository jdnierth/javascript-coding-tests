<ul>

        The function reduce takes an array and reduces the elements to a single value. For example it can sum all the
        numbers, multiply them, or any operation that you can put into a function.
    </li>
</ul>

<pre>
   var nums = [4, 1, 3];
var add = function(a, b) { return a + b; }
reduce(nums, add, 0);   //-> 8
</pre>

<p>
    Here's how it works. The function has an "accumulator value" which starts as the initialValue and accumulates the
    output of each loop. The array is iterated over, passing the accumulator and the next array element as arguments to
    the callback. The callback's return value becomes the new accumulator value. The next loop executes with this new
    accumulator value. In the example above, the accumulator begins at 0. add(0,4) is called. The accumulator's value is
    now 4. Then add(4, 1) to make it 5. Finally add(5, 3) brings it to 8, which is returned.
