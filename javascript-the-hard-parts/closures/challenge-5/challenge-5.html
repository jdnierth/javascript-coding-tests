<h1>Challenge 5</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        Write a function <code>once</code> that accepts a callback as input and returns a function.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the returned function is called the first time, it should call the callback and return that output.
    </li>
    <li>
        If it is called any additional times, instead of calling the callback again it will simply return the output value from the first time it was called.
    </li>
</ul>
