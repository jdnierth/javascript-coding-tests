#How do you provide a new object with further properties?
* Adds some default properties to the Object you are creating.

```
var animal= {
    kind: "human"
}

var person = Object.create(animal,  
    {
        name: {
            value: "Jessica"
        }
    }
);

console.log(person);
```
* Don't pass in an object as second parameter that describes the new property, hence it has to be a key value pair 
whereas the value is an object itself.
