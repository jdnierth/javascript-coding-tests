#What is meant by Constructor or Pseudo classical inheritance?
* Use of function constructor and the `new` keyword
```
"use strict";

function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;

    this.getFullName = function() {
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
}

var jes = new Person("Jessica", "Nierth");
console.log(jes.getFullName());
```

* If the `new` operator would be missing and having the `use strict` declared, `this` would be `undefined` and the code would error out in the first line of the constructor.

#How could you rewrite the code above instead to get to the same result?

```
"use strict";

function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    
    
    this.getFullName = function() {
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
}

var jes = {};
    
Person.call(jes, "Jessica", "Nierth");
```
