#What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?

##Classical inheritance
* Class: Acts as a blue print, a design, a diagram. 
* Then you create an instance of that blue print which is like building a house with the specs of that diagram.
* "You can not live in a class but you can live in an instance of a house".

##Prototypal inheritance
* In JavaScript you have prototypal inheritance. New objects are created from existing objects. 
* Here you don't have a diagram, instead you build a house based on an existing house.
  * It is sometimes called `Psdeudo-Classical Pattern` or `constructor pattern`: Using JavaScript `classes`
  * `Prototypal (OO) Pattern`: `__proto__` or `Object.create`
  
###ES5 Prototype Pattern
```
var Creature = function(name, type){
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
}

Creature.prototype.greeting = function(txt) {
    console.log(`Hi, I am a ${this.type}`);
}

// Subclassing
var Animal = function(name, type, skill) {
    Creature.call(this, name, type);
    this.skill = skill;
}

Animal.prototype = Object.create(Creature.prototype);
Animal.prototype.constructor = Creature;
Animal.prototype.canBark = function() {
    return "I can " + this.skill;
}
```

###ES6 Class
```
class Creature {
    constructor(name, type) {
        this.name = name;
        this.type = type;
    }
    
    greeting(txt) {
        console.log(`Hi, I am a ${this.type}`);
    }
}

class Animal extends Creature{
    constructor(name, type, skill) {
        this.name = name;
        this.type = type;
        this.skill = skill;
    }
    
    canBark() {
        console.log(`I can ${this.skill}`);
    }
}

var creature = new Animal("Jessica", "dog", "bark");
console.log(creature.constructor); //Function, Animal, 
console.log(creature.greeting()); //"Hi, I am a dog";
console.log(creature.canBark()); //"I can bark";
```
