#What is the `prototype chain`?
* Every object in JavaScript has a prototype.
* If searching for a property JavaScript will first look for that property on the object itself, then it will move up
 the prototype chain in order to find it.
 
##Example 1
```
var animal =  {
    kind: "human"
};
```
* animals Prototype `__proto__` is object.
* Note: `__proto__` is not part of the JavaScript language until EcmaScript 6.

##Example 2
```
var animal =  {
    kind: "human"
};

var person =  {};

person.__proto__ = animal;

console.log(person.kind);
```

##How can you check if an object is a prototype for another object?

```
animal.isPrototypeOf(person); // true
```

* WARNING: updating a property that previously existed on the prototype of an object, adds it to the object instead of 
updating it in the prototype.

#Example 3:

```
var animal =  {
    kind: "human"
};

var person =  {};

person.__proto__ = animal;

person.kind = "single";

console.log(person.kind);
```
* The property `kind` in line `person.kind` will add the property `kind` to the object person instead of updating it 
on its prototype object `animal`.
