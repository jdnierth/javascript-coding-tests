#Q: What does the `this` keyword mean in JavaScript?


#What is the value of `this` in the global scope?
```
console.log(this);
```
* Requesting the value of `this` in the global scope in a browser it will return `window`.

#What is the value of `this` inside a function?
```
function checkThis() {
    console.log(this);
}

checkThis();
```
* The code above will print out `window`.

#What is the value of `this` if being called on a method?

```
var person = {
    name:"Jessica",
    sayHello: function() {
        console.log(this);
    }
}

person.sayHello();
```
* The value of `this` of the code above will be the object `person`
* In this scenario the value of `this` will point to the object on which the method was called - NOT DECLARED!

#What is the value of `this` in the following scenario?


```
var person = {
    name:"Jessica",
    sayHello: function() {
        console.log(this);
    }
}

var func = person.sayHello;

func();
```
* In the code above if the function `func` is being executed the value of `this` will be the global object (window) 
since `func` itself hasn't been provided with a context.

#What is the value of `this` when being called within a nested function?

```
var person = {
    name:"Jessica",
    sayHello: function() {
        console.log(this); // 1. 
        
        function checkMe() {
            console.log(this); // 2.
        }
        
        checkMe();
    }
}

person.sayHello();
```
* The value of `this` within the first `console.log` will be the object `person`
* The value of `this` within the second `console.log` will be the global scope (window).
