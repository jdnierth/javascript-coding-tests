#What are the different types in JavaScript?
* `undefined`: Variable declared but not assigned any value. Used by the engine.
* `null`: Set by a developer to indicate that there is no value vor this variable.

#Gotcha
* typeof(null) == 'object'
* typeof(undefined) == 'undefined'
* In JavaScript null and undefined are each values with their own type whereas in other languages they represent the 
absence of values.
* null == undefined && undefined == null// true
