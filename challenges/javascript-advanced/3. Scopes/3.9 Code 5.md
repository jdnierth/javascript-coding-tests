#Consider the code snippet below. What will the console output be?
* https://gist.github.com/jawache/26481024e6274f950b97

```
(function(x) {
    return (function(y) {
        console.log(x);
    })(2)
})(1);
```

* The code will print out 1.
* Javascript searches the functions outer scope and in there it will find x and the value of x is 1 since that is what
 was passed in through the IIFE.
