#What will the following code output to the console?
* https://gist.github.com/jawache/a3cbdfccd2271a526ad0

```
console.log(
  (function f(n){
    return ((n > 1) ? n * f(n-1) : n)
  })(4)    
);
```

* The code will print out 24.
* This is an IIFE that actually performs a factorial, so 4! which is 24
