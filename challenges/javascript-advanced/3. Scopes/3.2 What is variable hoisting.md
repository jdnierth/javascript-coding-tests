#Q: What is variable hoisting?

Looking at the following code example
```
"use strict"
console.log(a);
var a = 1;
```
usually when using ´use strict´, the code should fail because a variable is accessed before it has been declared BUT because of hoisting this error doesn't happen in this case. Instead with hoisting the the declaration of the variable `a` will be moved to the top most position (if it is in global scope, at the top of the file, if it is within a function, at the beginning of the function), changing the code
 to this:
```
"use strict"
var a;
console.log(a);
a = 1;
```
The result oft the console log will be undefined since the variable a had been declared but no value has been 
assigned to it.
