#Q: What are Closures?

* `Closures` 


```
"use strict";
    
function sayHello(name) {
    var text = "Hello " + name;
    
    return function innerFunc() {
        console.log(text);
    }   
}

var sayHi = sayHello("Jessica");

sayHi();
```
* Line 18 will print out `Hello Jessica`
* Although the function sayHello had been executed, once the inner function `innerFunc` is being called, it still 
retains access to it's outer variable `name`. 
* the variable `text` within `innerFunc` is a closure as it closes over the variable `name` until it is done.
* Closures can refer to variables in outer scopes even if those outer functions have returned.
