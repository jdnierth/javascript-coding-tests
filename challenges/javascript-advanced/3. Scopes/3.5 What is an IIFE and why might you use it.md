#Q: What is an IIFE?

* `IIFE` stands for immediately invoked function expression


```
"use strict";
    
(function() {

})();
```

##What would you use an IIFE use for?
* Avoid pollution of the global scope by creating privately scope variables or functions.
* Let's say you have two files a.js and b.js

File a.js
```
"use strict";
var txt = "Hi a";

function hello() {
    console.log(txt);
}
hello();
```

File b.js
```
"use strict";

var txt = "Hi b";

function hello() {
    console.log(txt);
}
hello();
```
* If a.js and b.js are included one after the other and the function `hello()` is being called, then the result will 
always be `Hi a` and then `Hi b` since the file that comes last and their content is being defined globally will 
overwrite the declaration of its former variable declaration.
* In order to be able to avoid the overwriting nature, we can put an IIFE around the code which transforms the 
variables `txt` into private to their files.

## Solution via IIFE
File a.js
```
(function() {
    "use strict";
    var txt = "Hi a";
    
    function hello() {
        console.log(txt);
    }
    hello();
})();
```

File b.js
```
(function() {
    "use strict";
    var txt = "Hi a";
    
    function hello() {
        console.log(txt);
    }
    hello();
})();
```
* The variable `txt` won't leak out to the global scope any more and they won't overwrite each others values.
