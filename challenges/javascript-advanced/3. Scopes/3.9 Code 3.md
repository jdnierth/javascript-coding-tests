#What will this code print?
* https://gist.github.com/jawache/1385aa370cf0d9dcf009
* What gets logged to the console when the user clicks on “Button 4”?

```
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  var btn = document.createElement('button');
  
  btn.appendChild(document.createTextNode('Button ' + i));
  btn.addEventListener('click', function(){ alert(i); });
  
  document.body.appendChild(btn);
}
```

* By the time the function is called, even though it's kept a reference to the "i" variable in it's closure, the i variable at that point is actually 5.
