#What will this code print?
* https://gist.github.com/jawache/7153e555fea2db73b952

```
console.log(moo);
var moo = function() {
    console.log("loo");
};
```

* The code above will print out `undefined`.
* The variable moo will be hoisted above the console.log, because of that it is declared but it`s value will be 
undefined
