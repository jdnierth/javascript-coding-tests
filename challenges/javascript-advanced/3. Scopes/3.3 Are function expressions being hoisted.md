Q: Are function expressions being hoisted?
* No

Q: What is the result of the following code and why?
```
"use strict"

foo();

var foo = function() {
    console.log("hellow");
}
```
* The code above will print out `undefined is not a function` because when foo is being called, the value of foo is `undefined`. Only the variable declaration of the function expression is being hoisted but not the initialization.

```
"use strict"

var foo;
foo();

foo = function() {
    console.log("hello");
}
```
