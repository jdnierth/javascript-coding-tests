#Q: What is the result of the following code and why?

```
"use strict";
    
var foo = [];

for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    foo[i] = function() {
        return i;
    }
}

console.log(foo[0]()); // 1.
console.log(foo[1]()); // 2.
console.log(foo[2]()); // 3.
```

* What: When running the code above the result of the comment markers will be:
1. 10
2. 10
3. 10

* Why: Once the returned function of foo will be finally called, the loop has already been executed. At that point in
 time the value of i will always be 10.
* Keep in mind that the value of the closure will be the CURRENT value the variable has at the time of the functions 
execution.
 
#Q: What can be done in order to fix the code? so that the following will be returned 1.: 0, 2.: 1, 3.: 2

## Solution 1: Use an IIFE and put the variable i into a closure

```
"use strict";
    
var foo = [];

for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    (function(j) {
        foo[j] = function() {
            return j;
        }
    })(i);
}

console.log(foo[0]()); // 1.
console.log(foo[1]()); // 2.
console.log(foo[2]()); // 3.
```

* The variable i will be put in a closure, keeping a reference of when the function was called. By invoking it 
immediately the current value of the i will be "cached".

## Solution 2: Using let

```
"use strict";
    
var foo = [];

for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    foo[i] = function() {
        return i;
    }
}

console.log(foo[0]()); // 1.
console.log(foo[1]()); // 2.
console.log(foo[2]()); // 3.
```
