#Consider the code snippet below. What will the console output?
* https://gist.github.com/jawache/3cddd2b0a27f8ea6a460

```
function loo() {
  var goo = 1;
  moo();
}

function moo() {
  console.log(goo);
}

loo();
```
* The code will throw a `ReferenceError: goo is undefined` since `moo` has not been defined within the scope
 of the function `loo`. Hence `moo` has no access to the variable `goo`.
* The scope chain lookup rules follow how the code is written on the page. The moo function doesn't see the goo 
variable either in it's local or outer global scope so the javascript engine throws an error.
