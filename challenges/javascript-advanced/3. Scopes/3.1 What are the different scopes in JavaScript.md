#Q: What do we mean by `scope` in JavaScript?
* Scope refers to the visibility and availability within the code 

#Q: What are the different scopes in JavaScript?
1. Global Scope
* in the browser environment this will be the window object
* in NodeJS this would be [global](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global)
* If a variable is declared outside of a function.
* Those variables can be accessed anywhere else except it has been re-defined (shadowed).

2. Function / local scope
* Any variable declared inside a function is local to that function from within the block of the function.
```
function foo() {
    var a = "hello";
}

console.log(a);
```
* The code above will fire a `ReferenceError` saying a is undefined.
* Note: Other languages have block scope

3. Block scope
JavaScript has block scope in some instances:
* error in the try/catch case
* let is block scoped
