#Q: What is the scope chain?

* If functions are nested within other function scopes and the inner function needs to look for a variable but can't find it within it's own scope, it will look up what is called the ´scope chain´  for that variable until it reaches the global scope.
* The scope chain is defined `lexically`, the order in which the program was written in the file
```
"use strict";

function foo() {
    console.log(myVar);
}

function bar() {
    var myVar = 1;
    foo();
}

bar();
```
* The program above will fire a `ReferenceError` saying `myVar` is not defined.
* The `myVar` variable isn't available within foo because `myVar` wasn't declared within or above the `foo` function. 

##Fixing the first program
```
"use strict";


function bar() {
    var myVar = 1;
        
    function foo() {
        console.log(myVar);
    }

    foo();
}

bar();
```
* print out 1. once foo is being executed and the variable `myVar` is being requested in the console.log, it won't find the variable within its local scope and then move one level up to the scope of bar, where it will finally find the value of `myVar`.
