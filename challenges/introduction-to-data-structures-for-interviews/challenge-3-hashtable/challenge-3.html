<h1>HashTable</h1>

<p>
    Implement the data structure of a <code>HashTable</code>. Implement the following functions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>insert:  Inserts a new key-value pair (constant time)</li>
    <li>remove: Deletes a key-value pair (constant time)</li>
    <li>retrieve: Returns the value associated with a key (constant time)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A Hashtable is not ordered, we don't sort them although you could.</li>
    <li>Good for fast lookups and having flexible keys.</li>
    <li>Quick insertion with keys that can be more than numbers.</li>
    <li>Hashing function: Mathematical calculate location of values. Takes the key (string) and hashes it to a numerical value which is an index to an array (under the hood it will be a memory address).
        A hashing function will always give the same output for the same input.
    </li>
    <li>If you are implementing a HashTable once it becomes 50% full, you want to double it, then you rehash the values. The hasFunction should take the size.</li>
</ul>
