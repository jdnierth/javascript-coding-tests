<h1>Quick Sort</h1>

<h2>Task</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Write a function <code>quickSort</code>(https://btholt.github.io/four-semesters-of-cs/)</li>
    <li>
        Quicksort should grab a pivot from the end and then separate the list (not including the pivot)
        into two lists, smaller than the pivot and larger than the pivot.
    </li>
    <li>
        Call quickSort on both of those lists independently.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once those two lists come back sorted, concatenate the "left" (or smaller numbers) list, the pivot, and the
        "right" (or larger numbers) list and return that. The base case is when quickSort is called on a list with
        length less-than-or-equal-to 1. In the base case, just return the array given.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Choose a pivot element from the end of the list to sort
    </li>
    <li>
        Separate the list (excluding the pivot) into 2 lists
    </li>
    <li>
        O(n log n) but takes up less memory than mergesort.
    </li>
    <li>
        Though it performs poorly if an already sorted list is passed.
    </li>
</ul>

    <code>
        [4,9,3,5]
        p = 5
        l = [4,3]
        r = [9]
        > call quicksort on both lists

        =============

        [4,3]
        p = 3
        l = []
        r = [4]

        =============

        [4]
        p = 4
        l = []
        r = []
        > return [4] as it has a length of 1

        > concat([],3,[4] ==> [3,4]

        =============

        [9]
        p = 9
        l = []
        r = []
        > returns [9] because it has the length 1
        > concat([],[9]) ==> [9]
        =============
        > concat([3,4],5,[9]) ==> [3,4,5,9]
