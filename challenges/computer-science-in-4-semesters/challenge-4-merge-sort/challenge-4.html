<h1>Merge Sort</h1>

<h2>Task</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Write a function <code>mergeSort</code>(https://btholt.github.io/four-semesters-of-cs/)</li>
    <li>
        It will take in a array of numbers and return a sorted array numbers
    </li>
    <li>Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).</li>
    <li>
        Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Breaks up the list in to 2 half sized lists and call merge sort on those smaller lists, then divide those smaller
        lists again, etc ... so often until you end up with a list of 1 and merge the sorted lists together.</li>
    <li>Array.sort mostly uses mergeSort under the hood (depending on the engine and data type sometimes quick sort)</li>
    <li>Works with constant speed</li>
    <li>The complexity of mergeSort is O(n log(n)), it uses recursion.</li>
    <li>With MergeSort we have to create new lists as we go, it's space complexity is O(n).</li>
</ul>

        [1,5,6,2,7,8]
        [1,5,6] sublist 1
        [2,7,8] sublist 2
        --> compare 1 and 2 --> put 1 in a new list
        --> compare 5 and 2 --> put 2 in a new list
        --> compare 5 and 7 --> put 5 in a new list
        --> compare 6 and 7 --> put 6 in a new list
        --> list 1 has no more elements add the rest of list 2  in order (7 and 8)
