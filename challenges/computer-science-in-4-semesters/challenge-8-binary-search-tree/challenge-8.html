<h1>Binary Search Tree (BST)</h1>
<h2>Task</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Create a class called Tree.
    </li>
    <li>Your Tree class will have keep track of a root which will be the first item added to you tree. From there, if
        the item is less than the value of that node, it will go into its left subtree
        and if greater it will go to the right subtree.
    </li>
    <li>
        In order for this to work and for the unit tests to pass you, you must implement a Tree .toObject function that
        returns your tree as a series of nested objects. Those nested objects must use the following names for their
        properties
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a class called Node.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Node has two properties, value and next.
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>value - integer     - value being contained in the node</li>
            <li>left  - Node/object - the left node which itself may be another tree</li>
            <li>right - Node/object - the right node which itself may be another tree</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
