<h1>Exercise 6</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        Write two functions, each which return a fixed number (different from each other) when called.
    </li>
    <li>Write an <code>add(..)</code> function that takes two numbers and adds them and returns the result. Call
        <code>add(..)</code> with the results of your two functions from (1) and print the result to the console.
    </li>
    <li>Write an <code>add2(..)</code> that takes two functions instead of two numbers, and it calls those two functions
        and then sends those values to <code>add(..)</code>, just like you did in (2) above.
    </li>
    <li>Replace your two functions from (1) with a single function that takes a value and returns a function back, where
        the returned function will return the value when it's called.
    </li>
    <li>Write an <code>addn(..)</code> that can take an array of 2 or more functions, and using only
        <code>add2(..)</code>, adds them together. Try it with a loop. Try it without a loop (recursion). Try it with
        built-in array functional helpers (map/reduce).
    </li>
    <li>Start with an array of odd and even numbers (with some duplicates), and trim it down to only have unique values.
    </li>
    <li>Filter your array to only have even numbers in it.
    </li>
    <li>Map your values to functions, using (4), and pass the new list of functions to the <code>addn(..)</code> from
        (5).
    </li>
    <li>Bonus: write tests for your functions.
    </li>
