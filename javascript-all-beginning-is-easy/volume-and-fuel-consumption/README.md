# volume-and-fuel-consumption

**Section: Type coersion**

**Exercise**
Write a program to visualize the volume and fuel consumption for 
passenger cars. 

The user should enter the driven kilometers (distance) and
the consumed fuel.

**Note**: Use the following formula<br/>
`consumption[l/100km] = consumed fuel [l] / distance [km] x 100`

Extend the program with a tank size and then calculates the maximum 
distance in Kilometers. 

**Note**: Use the following formula<br/>
`distance [km] = tankSize [l] / consumption [l/ km]`
