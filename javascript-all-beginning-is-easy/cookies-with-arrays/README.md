Exercise 40 of the book 'JavaScript all beginning is easy'

**Exercise**
Write a 'digital' recipe book, the ingredients will be available as an Array.

1. Create the first recipe - oats cookies - with an Array that contains the following ingredients
70ml Raps Oil
1 isolated egg
100 g sugar
1tsp baking powder
2. The list is missing flour. Add 1 table spoon flour
3. Add 100g oats to the top position of the list
4. Replace Raps Oil with 75g of butter
5. Convert the Array into a String that prints the list of ingredients.
6. Add the following how to to the recipe
`Melt the butter in a pan, add the oatmeal and mix well. Then remove 
the mass from the oven and allow it to cool slightly. Then beat the egg 
white with sugar and stir in the egg yolk, baking powder and flour. Now 
mix the mixture with the cooled oat flakes. Place small dough piles on 
a baking tray. 
The piles should not be too big, as the dough is slightly diverging when 
baking. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 170 Â° C for 15 minutes.`
